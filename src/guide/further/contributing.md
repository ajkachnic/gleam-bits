# Contributing

This project is early, so contributions are welcome but the process isn't quite
ironed out. If you're interested in contributing, whether it's a typo fix,
correction, suggestion, or something else, please open an issue or a PR.

I'm hesitant to accept new _content_ (guides or pages) without more discussion,
but I'm happy to talk about it. My main concern is a lack of cohension and
consistency across the guide. I'm not sure how to approach this, but I'm open to
suggestions (_prior art is probably useful here_)
